    <p className="education"><strong>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Trilogy Education):</strong>Recently, I attended a full-stack coding bootcamp at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Trilogy Education) to pursue my dream of being a web developer. During this 6-month program I was fully immersed in languages, frameworks and programs such as HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery Node.js, Express.js, Git and REACT.  </p>

    <p className="education"><strong>Excelsior College:</strong>I attended Excelsior College from 2014-2016 and received an Associates Degree of Applied Sciences in Technology.  I focused my classes on Networking and took classes in Visual Basic and Java.  I used the skills and education that I achieved in the military to fast track my education and add a formal education to my real world skills.</p>

    <p className="education"><strong>The United States Army:</strong>I proudly served 4 years in the United States Army.  During my time in the military I learned skills such as discipline, leadership, teamwork and chain of command.  I also attended school to be a Signal Support Systems Specialist in Augusta, Georgia.  It was there in Georgia where I found my passion for technology and I have worked in the tech field ever since.   </p>
